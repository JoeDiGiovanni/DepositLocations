William Hill Coding Challenge

Nevada’s largest sports book operator, William Hill, offers convenient deposit locations at William Hill sports books,
kiosks at PT’s Taverns, 7-Eleven stores, CVS stores, and Family Dollar stores throughout Nevada.

As a superstar William Hill backend engineer, you’ve been asked to implement a system that will provide app users
with directions to their nearest deposit location.

Using your favorite JVM (Scala preferred) or .NET runtime language, implement a console application that will parse the input
 and for each user return the path to the nearest deposit location and the total travel time to reach that destination.

The first section of input defines a bi-directional graph in which the nodes are waypoints or deposit locations,
and the edges are travel times. Waypoints are represented with the letter W followed by a number (e.g. “W4”).
Deposit locations are represented with “SB”, “7E”, “PTS”, “CVS” or “FD”:
<node 1> <node 2> <travel time>

The next section of input consists of app usernames followed by their current location:
<username> <node>

Your program’s output should be in the following format:
<username> <node 1> <node 2> <node 3> <total travel time>

Example Input:
W1 W3 4
W1 SB 2
W2 W4 5
W3 W2 3
W3 W5 5
W3 7E 6
W4 W8 4
W5 PTS 3
W6 W3 3
W6 7E 2
W7 W5 5
W7 7E 2
W7 FD 1
W8 W9 8
W8 CVS 2
W9 W10 6
W10 CVS 5
User123 W9
User234 W3

Example Output:
User123 W9 W8 CVS 10
User234 W3 W6 7E 5
